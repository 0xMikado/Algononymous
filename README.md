<h2>Algononymous</h2>

This repository result from my semester project in collaboration with the EPFL Machine Learning and Optimization lab, as well as the intelligent Global Health program.

The aim of this project is to provide IDDO with a personalized tool to analyze the privacy risk
created by a new third party medical research. Based on the research needs in terms of data
and precision. To then, apply anonymization techniques that would fit our dynamic privacy
threshold.

It contains:
  - Project report
  - A Rshiny web app that you can run on R
  - Scripts taken from IDDO I used during the semester
  
To run the R shiny web app you need to open the app.R file within Rstudio and launch the app. All infromation about the progress on Algononymous, the choice of framework and features can be found in the report
